# Thomson
The Thomson problem is a classic problem in physics and mathematics that deals with finding the minimum energy configuration of a collection of point charges (electrons) on the surface of a sphere. The problem was first proposed by the physicist J.J. Thomson in 1904, and it has been studied extensively since then.

The Thomson problem has many applications in physics and chemistry, including the study of atomic and molecular structures. The problem is also of interest in mathematics and computer science, as it involves finding the optimal arrangement of a large number of points in three-dimensional space.

Thomson program has been developed to solve the Thomson problem inside the torus. This program uses Conjucated gradient mathematical technique and computational algorithms to find the optimal configuration of charges on the surface of a torus, which is a doughnut-shaped object.

The program written using FORTRAN 90 language with Python3 GUI to help the user making the input files and running the program.

# Prerequisite

* 1 - Fortran compiler (gfortran recommended):

```
sudo apt install gfortran
```
* 2 - Fortran library (llapack, openmp):
  
```
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev libopenblas-dev libomp-dev
```
* 3 - For animation (gnuplot, FFmpeg):

```
sudo apt-get install gnuplot ffmpeg
```
* 4 - Python (Python 3, not working using python 2 because it need some library )

```
sudo apt-get install python3 
```
* 5 - Python library (numpy,tkinter,customtkinter) to use the python GUI

```
pip3 install customtkinter tkinter numpy 
```

 
# Build

* build the program
  
```sh
make Thomson
```
* clean the bin files
```sh
make clean
```
# Usage 

* Using Python code

```sh
python Thomson.py
``` 
* Thomson

```sh
./Thomson "The input file name"
```
  
# Example

there are some example of the inputfile in the [examples folder](https://github.com/ALRAKIK/Thomson/tree/main/example) you can try to use them.
